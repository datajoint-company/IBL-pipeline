This JupyterHub serves as an interface to access the public database of [international brain laboratory](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/). 

The directory `public_notebooks` contains the shared notebooks to explore the IBL data pipeline and replicate the figures in the publication. The contents in the notebooks in this directory will be restored after the server is restarted.

The directory `private_notebooks` is the space for your own notebooks. The contents of the notebooks in this 


# Figure replication for the behavior paper

The notebook `public_notebooks/Replication of Figure 2a and b` replicates Figure 2 in the study ["A standardized and reproducible method to measure decision-making in mice"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.17.909838). 

`paper_behavior_functions.py` and `uuids_trained1.npy` are helper functions and files that are necessary for the figure replication.



# Explore IBL pipeline

The directory `public_notebooks/Explore IBL pipeline` contains several notebooks that guide the readers to explore the IBL data pipeline and access the IBL public database locally. Notebook 03 steps through the process to replicate Figure 2a and b.
